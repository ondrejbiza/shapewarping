# One-shot Imitation Learning via Interation Warping

TODO:
* Write tests for functions in learn_warp.
* Write tests remaining functions in utils.
* Refactor show warp.
* Add comments and types to demo.
* Add comments and types to ndf_interface.
* Add comments and types to object_warping.
* Make sure I have the right dependencies.
* Provide a docker image for R-NDF.

This repo is a refactored version of the code for my paper Interaction Warping published at CoRL'23.
