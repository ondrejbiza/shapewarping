# One-shot Imitation Learning via Interation Warping

TODO:
* Make sure I have the right dependencies.
* Provide a docker image for R-NDF.

This repo is a refactored version of the code for my paper Interaction Warping published at CoRL'23.

Website: https://shapewarping.github.io/

Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12392

Original code (includes real-world UR5 code): https://github.com/ondrejbiza/fewshot

## Troubleshooting

1. `pip install cycpd` doesn't work on Mac. But, the following works:
```
git clone https://github.com/gattia/cycpd
cd cycpd
pip install -e .
```
